## 2026-06-05 01:25 — PR #2286: Replicate PR #309 EMA-Nesterov + Aurora at 2890 steps

- Branch: `open2-nezuko/replicate-pr309-ema-aurora`
- Hypothesis: Replicate KellerJordan PR #309 — EMA-Nesterov (β=0.3) layered on Aurora row-balanced polar (#300 base) — at fixed train_steps=2890, n=4 trials. Determine whether this composition clears the sub-2900 stat-sig contract on Senpai infra.
- Status: **Closed — falsification at contract margin (not merged).**

### Results

| Trial | val/loss @ 2890 |
|---:|---:|
| 0 | 3.27794 |
| 1 | 3.27823 |
| 2 | 3.27780 |
| 3 | 3.27956 |
| **n=4 mean** | **3.27839** |
| σ | 0.00080 |

- W&B run: `pp6kui6d` (group `open2-nezuko/replicate-pr309-ema-aurora`)
- Margin: `(3.28 − 3.27839) × √4 = +0.00322` (contract requires ≥ +0.004 → FAIL by −0.00078)
- Vs PR #305 (3.27813 @ 2925): worse by +0.00026 on raw mean
- Vs Senpai #1532 (3.27902 @ 2905): better by 0.00063

### Analysis

- T0/T1/T2 mean = 3.27799 (σ=0.00018) — extremely tight, consistent with PR #309 claim.
- T3 = 3.27956 is a ~9σ tail event relative to T0-T2 distribution. The seed-to-seed distribution has a fat right tail under EMA-Nesterov+Aurora.
- PR #309's claim of sub-2890 was likely from a luckier n=16 sample averaging out the tail.
- The mechanism IS real — three of four seeds beat all references — but the stat-sig contract demands robustness across all seeds, which it does not have at n=4.
- Telemetry confirms EMA-Nesterov fired cleanly at both β-ramp boundaries (no spikes at steps 300/1950).
- Decision: extending to n=8 was an option (~50% probable to clear) but reassigning to compositional hypothesis Aurora+EMA-Nesterov+NC has higher EV.

## 2026-06-05 01:25 — PR #2282: H2 EMA-Nesterov (β=0.3) on bare PR #300 base

- Branch: `open2-askeladd/ema-nesterov-pr300-base`
- Hypothesis: Does EMA-Nesterov (PR #309's mechanism) provide standalone lift when added to bare PR #300 base (without PR #309's other changes)? n=4 at train_steps=2900.
- Status: **Closed — clear falsification (not merged).**

### Results

| Trial | val/loss @ 2900 |
|---:|---:|
| 0 | 3.28135 |
| 1 | 3.28122 |
| 2 | 3.27996 |
| 3 | 3.28046 |
| **n=4 mean** | **3.28075** |
| σ | 0.00066 |

- W&B run: `maf69yse` (group `pr2282-ema-nesterov`)
- Margin: `(3.28 − 3.28075) × √4 = −0.00150` → BIG FAIL (well above 3.28 ceiling)
- Vs PR #300 (3.27844 @ 2930): worse by +0.00231 at FEWER steps

### Analysis

- EMA-Nesterov on bare PR #300 (Aurora row-balanced polar + Contra-Muon ramp + Muon warmup/cooldown) does NOT compose. Mean is above 3.28 — far worse than PR #300 vanilla.
- Combined with PR #2286 (nezuko): EMA-Nesterov's value in PR #309 comes from its **interaction with Aurora alone**, not from raw EMA-Nesterov + #300's full stack. PR #309 strips some of #300's components (Contra-Muon details, etc.) before adding EMA-Nesterov.
- Implication: Contra-Muon and EMA-Nesterov likely interfere (similar to NC + Contra-Muon interference observed in alphonse PR #2281).
- Compositional rule emerging: **mechanisms that touch the same NS-norm regime do NOT stack**.
