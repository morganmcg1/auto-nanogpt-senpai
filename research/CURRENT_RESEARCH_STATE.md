## Active experiments (all on r4)

### ✅ fern #408 — Adaptive Gradient Clipping (AGC) — CLOSED 14:15 UTC productive-null

Paired-pod confirmation collapsed pod-0 signal. Final n=3 pooled: mean(val_B)=3.27271 > baseline 3.27200 → pre-staged rule triggers CLOSE. Pod-0 Δ=−0.00252 was favorable-seed luck. AGC mechanism consistent (99.4% trigger rate) but val benefit not reproducible. **16th productive-null this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: fern assigned **#477 OrthoGrad for aux groups**.

### ✅ fern #477 — OrthoGrad for aux AdamW groups — CLOSED 21:35 UTC productive-null

Arms B (embed: +0.00163), C (lm_head: +0.00285) regress; D (embed+lm_head: −0.00080) recovers. Non-monotonic: single-group breaks embed/lm_head magnitude balance; combined restores it. D Δ=−0.00080 passes stat-rule on absolute baseline but well short of −0.002 within-pod threshold — productive-null. **22nd productive-null/negative this cycle.** Key finding: aux groups co-evolve as a coupled system, resist single-axis gradient intervention.
**Follow-up**: fern assigned **#514 β₁ warmup on aux AdamW groups** — first-moment smoothing-rate schedule axis.

### ✅ fern #514 — AdamW β₁ warmup on aux groups — CLOSED 06:15 UTC productive-NEGATIVE

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS): A=3.27279, B=+0.00135 (null edge), C=+0.00162 (regression), D=+0.00252 (regression). Monotone-ish worsening with warmup aggressiveness. No arm passes stat-rule. **3rd consecutive "less constraint early" closure**: WD warmup (#483 NEGATIVE) + embed-LR warmup (#489 NEGATIVE) + β₁ warmup (#514 NEGATIVE) — bilateral closure across 3 aux-group AdamW schedule axes. Early-training window is uniformly well-tuned across WD/LR/β₁ at merged settings. **28th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: fern assigned **#547 lm_head cooldown SHAPE sweep** — pivot from temporal (warmup) to shape (cooldown) axes.

### ✅ fern #584 — lm_head AdamW LR multiplier sweep around 1.0× — CLOSED 22:00 UTC productive-NULL

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27141−3.27174|=0.00033): A=3.27141 ctrl, B (0.70×)=+0.00028 (null), C (1.30×)=+0.00257 (regression), D (0.50×)=+0.00233 (regression). Flat→degradation profile bracketing 1.00× ctrl on both sides; no arm beats baseline. **Joint vocab-budget hypothesis falsified** at B=0.70× = 1/1.5. **Asymmetric LR cliff** — same |Δmult|=0.30 produces +0.00257 above vs +0.00028 below; lm_head sits closer to upper cliff. **Decoupling confirmed**: embed_mult=1.5 and lm_head_mult=1.0 have orthogonal optima. **40th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: fern assigned **#618 Muon² for lm_head** — replace AdamW with NS-orthogonalized momentum on the output projection (IDEA 6 from WAVE3, genuinely untested mechanism replacement vs all prior magnitude/formula/schedule/regularization perturbations).

### ✅ fern #618 — Muon² for lm_head — CLOSED 06:00 UTC productive-NEGATIVE

**Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27313−3.27174|=0.00139)**:
| Arm | LM_HEAD_OPTIMIZER | LR | val/loss | Δ vs A | 3.28 target |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| A | adamw (ctrl) | n/a | 3.27313 | — | ✅ pass |
| B | muon | 0.005 | 3.28460 | **+0.01147** | ❌ MISS |
| C | muon | 0.010 | 3.28043 | **+0.00730** | ❌ MISS (by 0.00043) |
| D | muon | 0.002 | 3.29285 | **+0.01972** | ❌ MISS (worst) |

**Monotonic-LR pattern**: higher Muon LR → smaller regression. No interior minimum in 0.002–0.010; optimum (if any) lies at LR ≥ 0.010 but +0.00730 gap is too wide to plausibly close. Mechanism: **NS-orthogonalization homogenizes the vocabulary-frequency Hessian structure** lm_head needs. AdamW's `m/√v` preserves Zipf-distributed per-coordinate magnitude scaling; Muon's unit-singular-value post-NS update has only LR-controlled spectral magnitude (no per-vocab-direction scaling). Block-heterogeneity analysis (Zhang et al. 2024) consistent: lm_head's Hessian is qualitatively distinct from inner-block Hessians, and spectral conditioning that helps inner blocks actively harms output projection. Implementation hygiene clean (drift +0.00139, NS transpose-trick verified for (50257, 768) tall matrix, wall-clock parity ±0.4%). **46th productive-null/negative this cycle. \"Replace AdamW for lm_head\" axis fully closed.**
**Follow-up**: fern assigned **#652 Per-group AdamW eps sweep on lm_head** — within-AdamW axis directly motivated by #618 mechanism reading. eps controls per-coordinate magnitude scaling (the exact mechanism #618 implicates as lm_head's bottleneck). Last untested per-group AdamW hyperparameter (β₁/β₂/WD/LR-mult all swept).

### 🔄 fern #652 — Per-group AdamW eps sweep on lm_head [assigned 06:10 UTC]

**Branch:** `g1r4-fern/adamw-eps-per-group`
**Hypothesis**: After #618 closed "replace AdamW for lm_head with Muon" productive-NEGATIVE (mechanism: NS homogenizes Zipf-distributed per-coordinate magnitude scaling), the mirror question is whether AdamW's per-coordinate magnitude scaling on lm_head needs adjustment via the **eps denominator floor**. Currently uniform `eps=1e-10` across all AdamW groups — well below standard PyTorch default 1e-8. Per-group eps modulates rare-token-row update behavior: small eps → pure preconditioning (homogenizes magnitudes via `m/√v`); large eps → SGD-like updates (preserves magnitude differences). Last untested per-group AdamW hyperparameter (β₁ #599 NEG, β₂ #560 NEG, WD #593 NULL, LR-mult #393 MERGED).

| Arm | LM_HEAD_EPS | Mechanism tested |
|---|---:|---|
| A (ctrl) | 1e-10 | Reproduces merged baseline (bit-identical) |
| B | 1e-8 | Standard PyTorch default; rare-token coords near eps → mild magnitude-damping |
| C | 1e-6 | Aggressive damping; rare-token coords strongly SGD-like |
| D | 1e-12 | Opposite direction; even purer preconditioning |
**ETA full chain:** ~7.3h. Implementation effort: ~10 LOC (env var + per-group eps in dict, mirrors #593 WD per-group). Embed/scalar groups stay at 1e-10 (mechanism is lm_head-specific).

### ✅ fern #547 — lm_head cooldown SHAPE sweep — CLOSED 14:15 UTC productive-NULL

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27273−3.27174|=0.00099): A linear=3.27273, B cosine=+0.00012 (null), C late_peak=+0.00179 (regression), D linear_floor=+0.00024 (null). No arm meets −0.002 threshold. **Cross-axis SHAPE transfer hypothesis falsified**: NS late_peak does NOT transfer to lm_head — lm_head wants monotonic decay (dense AdamW group with no mid-phase quality plateau analogous to NS orthogonalization). Reproduces #454 Arm B (linear_floor null). **Per-group cooldown SHAPE design space now substantially characterized**: embed=linear_floor (#235), body=linear (#520 NEG on alternatives), NS_iter=late_peak (#285), NS_coef=linear_ramp_down (#290), lm_head=linear (#547 NEG on alternatives); scalar gap untested. **35th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: fern assigned **lm_head AdamW LR ratio sweep** — denser sweep around 1.0× on post-#393 stack (untested space: #393 rejected lm_head=1.5× but <1.0× and intermediate values unexplored; joint vocab update budget mechanism predicts ~0.67×).

### 🔄 tanjiro #441 — Logit Z-loss (PaLM style) [assigned 06:49 UTC]

Loss-side: `loss += λ · Σ_t logsumexp(logits_t)²`. Arm A (control) terminal, B/C/D in progress. λ ∈ {0.0, 1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3}.

### ✅ alphonse #442 — Adam-atan2 — CLOSED 17:53 UTC productive-NEGATIVE

b sweep {0.3, 1.0, 3.0}: all regress vs AdamW (b=0). D (b=3.0) misses 3.28 target (+0.010). Magnitude-transform of AdamW formula fully closed. **19th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: alphonse assigned **#489 embed-only LR warmup**.

### ✅ alphonse #489 — Embed-only LR warmup — CLOSED 01:47 UTC productive-NEGATIVE

Monotone catastrophic worsening: A=3.27054, B=+0.01026 (frac=0.02), C=+0.01554 (frac=0.05), D=+0.02316 (frac=0.10). All 3 warmup arms fail benchmark (none reach 3.28 target). Full embed LR from step 0 is load-bearing — #102 closure rationale ("early high-LR window is productive") extends to embed AdamW despite mechanistic distinction (sparse-grad vs Muon+NS). **25th productive-null/negative this cycle.** Bilateral closure with #483 WD warmup (also productive-NEGATIVE): the early-training window is bilaterally well-tuned; regularization-REDUCTION by warmup on any group fails.
**Follow-up**: alphonse assigned **#526 embed LR step-0 boost** — inverse direction (boost above 1.5× at step 0, decay to merged 1.5×).

### ✅ alphonse #526 — Embed LR step-0 boost — CLOSED 09:30 UTC productive-NULL (bilateral with #489)

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27226−3.27174|=0.00052): A=3.27226, B (2.0×, 3%)=−0.00080 (null), C (2.5×, 3%)=−0.00081 (null), D (2.0×, 6%)=+0.00035 (null). B/C plateau identically (boost magnitude saturates by 2.0×); D regresses (longer 6% window mildly worse). Best arm (C) Δ_vs_A=−0.00081 far short of pre-staged −0.002 paired-pod threshold; the n=1 stat-rule "baseline beat" is partly Arm-A drift artifact. `first_step_to_target` invariant across A/B/C=3225. **Bilateral closure with #489**: combined evidence establishes embed step-0 LR at 1.5× is bilaterally optimal — neither boosting (this PR) nor reducing (#489 NEGATIVE) the early embed LR yields actionable improvement. **31st productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: alphonse assigned **#560 Per-group AdamW β₂ asymmetric sweep** — fresh axis on second-moment time constant (per-group cut of uniform-β₂=0.99 merged setting); motivated by embed-sparsity insights from #474 AdaBelief and #516 Yogi closures.

### ✅ alphonse #560 — Per-group AdamW β₂ asymmetric sweep — CLOSED 17:15 UTC productive-NULL/NEGATIVE

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27121−3.27174|=0.00053): A=3.27121, B (β₂_embed=0.95)=+0.00089 (null), C (β₂_embed=0.999)=+0.00359 (regression), D (B + β₂_lm_head=0.999)=+0.00097 (null). No arm beats merged baseline within-pod. Longer embed memory clearly harmful (v_t anchors to early-training stats for ~700-step half-life in 3350-step run); shorter embed memory null (hypothesized sparse-row v_t reset benefit doesn't materialize). D ≈ B within ±0.0001 — lm_head β₂=0.999 inert. **AdamW-internal axis family substantially exhausted**: per-group β₂ joins #442 (magnitude), #474 (AdaBelief formulation), #516 (Yogi update rule), #490 (NAdam first-moment lookahead) as closed. Embed sparse-row gradient statistics on this benchmark are well-served by uniform β₂=0.99 in the 0.95–0.999 range. **38th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: alphonse assigned **per-group AdamW β₁ time-constant sweep** — first-moment time constant, structurally distinct from this PR's second-moment axis. Mechanism: at β₁=0.8 with sparse embed rows, momentum decays to near-zero between visits (`0.8^50 ≈ 0`), effectively scaling sparse-row step magnitude down by ~0.2 vs dense groups; ADAMW_EMBED_LR_MULT=1.5 partially compensates via LR; lowering β₁_embed tests whether it's a more principled magnitude restorer.

### ✅ alphonse #599 — Per-group AdamW β₁ time-constant sweep — CLOSED 01:10 UTC productive-NEGATIVE

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27208−3.27174|=0.00034): A=3.27208, B (β₁_embed=0.50)=+0.00399 (regression), C (β₁_embed=0.00, RMSProp-mode)=+0.00513 (regression), D (β₁_embed=0.90)=+0.00177 (regression marginal). All B/C/D regress past +0.0015 within-pod threshold. Magnitude-up direction (β₁ 0.80→0.50→0.00) shows monotone worsening — sparse-row magnitude restoration hypothesis disconfirmed; sparse-row momentum buffer is load-bearing (β₁=0 loses +0.005 vs ctrl). Smoothing-up direction (β₁=0.90) also marginal regression. **Per-group AdamW family fully exhausted on merged stack**: per-group β₁ (this PR) + per-group β₂ (#560) = both first-moment and second-moment time-constant axes closed-NEGATIVE in both directions; only embed-LR-mult lever (#393, MERGED) extracted gain. **44th productive-NEGATIVE this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: alphonse assigned **#632 Tunable post-NS aspect-ratio exponent** — post-NS-side modification targeting the canonical `max(1, fan_out/fan_in)**0.5` scaling in `muon_update()`. Explicitly flagged by triage note from #530 closure: "Future body-Muon ideas should target post-NS-side modifications."

### 🔄 alphonse #632 — Tunable post-NS aspect-ratio exponent [assigned 01:10 UTC]

**Branch:** `g1r4-alphonse/muon-post-ns-aspect-exp`
**Hypothesis**: Canonical post-NS scaling `update *= max(1, grad.size(-2) / grad.size(-1))**0.5` at line 642 applies a fixed aspect-ratio exponent of 0.5 from Bernstein-Newhouse (2024) modular norm theory. On the merged stack with NS_COEF_SCHEDULE=linear_ramp_down and NS_COOLDOWN_SHAPE=late_peak, the effective orthogonalization deviates from theory assumptions — making a different exponent potentially more effective. Tests exp=0 (no scaling, uniform body magnitudes), exp=0.25 (gentler), and exp=1.0 (full linear aspect-ratio amplification). This is one of the few remaining unexplored **post-NS-side modification** axes (flagged explicitly after #530 body-Muon mechanism closure).

| Arm | NANOGPT_MUON_POST_NS_EXP | Scale on QKV (fan_out/fan_in=3) | Scale on MLP-expand (4) | Tests |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| A | 0.50 (ctrl) | ×√3≈1.73 | ×2.0 | Canonical, reproduces merged baseline |
| B | **0.00** | ×1.0 (no scaling) | ×1.0 | No aspect-ratio bias — unifies body magnitudes |
| C | **0.25** | ×3^0.25≈1.32 | ×4^0.25≈1.41 | Gentler aspect bias, interior sweet spot |
| D | **1.00** | ×3.0 | ×4.0 | Full linear aspect scaling — amplified bias |
**ETA full chain:** ~7.3h. Implementation: ~5 LOC (env var + replace `**0.5` with `**NANOGPT_MUON_POST_NS_EXP` + print0 + W&B config).

### ✅ tanjiro #441 — Logit Z-loss sweep — CLOSED 17:00 UTC productive-NEGATIVE

Z-loss (PaLM style λ∈{1e-5,1e-4,1e-3}) regresses at all non-zero λ. D (λ=1e-3) fails benchmark (val=3.29393 > 3.28). Root cause: logit softcap c=15 already provides sufficient logit regularization — z-loss is redundant and competes at high λ. **18th productive-null/negative this cycle.** Loss-side auxiliary regularization axis fully closed.
**Follow-up**: tanjiro assigned **#487 cooldown-NS pruning ablation**.

### 🔄 tanjiro #577 — NS-cooldown joint-pruning — interaction test [assigned 13:05 UTC]

**Branch:** `g1r4-tanjiro/ns-cooldown-joint-pruning`
**Hypothesis**: All three NS-cooldown sub-stack components (NS_ITERS_COOLDOWN=16, NS_COOLDOWN_SHAPE=late_peak, NS_COEF_SCHEDULE=linear_ramp_down) were individually classified as redundant in #487 (all single-drop Δ in productive-null band; B confirmed at paired-pod n=3). But joint-drop interactions are untested. This 4-arm ablation tests whether the sub-stack is load-bearing *as a unit*: if joint-drop (Arm B) ≈ baseline → 3-axis stack simplification; if Arm B regresses → system interacts nonlinearly (individually redundant but jointly necessary). Arms C and D decompose the interaction.
| Arm | NS_ITERS_COOLDOWN | NS_COOLDOWN_SHAPE | NS_COEF_SCHEDULE | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 16 (ctrl) | late_peak | linear_ramp_down | Full merged stack control |
| B | **0** | step (inert) | **constant** | Full joint drop of all 3 |
| C | **0** | late_peak (inert) | linear_ramp_down | ITER-only drop (re-validates #487 paired-pod) |
| D | 16 | **step** | **constant** | SHAPE+COEF drop, ITER kept |
**Phase 1** (N=1 sweep ~7.3h) → **Phase 2** paired-pod confirmation if Arm B Δ ∈ null band or Δ ≤ −0.002. If Arm B Δ ≥ +0.005, Phase 1 is sufficient to close (sub-stack load-bearing at N=1).

### ✅ tanjiro #487 — Cooldown-NS pruning ablation — CLOSED 13:05 UTC productive-NULL [paired-pod n=3]

Sweep N=1 Arm B (drop NS_ITERS_COOLDOWN) Δ=−0.00385 winner candidate failed paired-pod confirmation: per-pod Δ split 1−/2+ around mean(Δ)=+0.00003, all three pods in productive-null/redundant band [−0.002, +0.0015]. Merge gates 1 (mean Δ) and 2 (mean val_B) fail; only stat-rule (gate 3) passes. **4th cycle precedent for single-seed → paired-pod collapse** (joining #344, #351, #408 AGC). Mechanism hypothesis (NS_ITERS_COOLDOWN over-orthogonalizes late-phase) falsified — within-pod effect is essentially zero. The N=1 winner was between-seed noise. **33rd productive-null this cycle.** All three NS-cooldown sub-stack components are now individually classified as redundant (B=redundant at n=3 paired-pod, C/D=null at N=1 sweep).
**Follow-up**: tanjiro assigned **NS-cooldown joint-pruning ablation** — joint-drop interaction test of the sub-stack.

### ✅ thorfinn #446 — Label smoothing sweep — CLOSED 15:38 UTC productive-NEGATIVE

Strictly monotone regression: A=3.27326 (ctrl), B=3.31900 (+0.046), C=3.37495 (+0.102), D=3.49666 (+0.223). B/C/D never reached 3.28 target. The merged stack already has three confidence-pressure regularizers (logit softcap=15, embed_lr_mult=1.5×, NS cooldown) — adding label smoothing subtracts gradient signal on already-regularized correct-token targets. **17th productive-null/negative this cycle.** Regularization-addition axes are fully closed.
**Follow-up**: thorfinn assigned **#483 WD warmup schedule** — first regularization-REDUCTION test this cycle.

### ✅ thorfinn #483 — WD warmup schedule (Muon block group) — CLOSED 23:42 UTC productive-NEGATIVE

Clean monotone worsening: A=3.27066, B=+0.00080 (null), C=+0.00258 (regression), D=+0.00400 (regression). Body-block WD=0.025 is load-bearing from step 0 — delaying it hurts. **24th productive-null/negative this cycle.** Bilateral closure: 17 ADD-regularization axes + 1 REDUCE-regularization axis both fail → Muon-WD=0.025 is bilaterally optimal.
**Follow-up**: thorfinn assigned **#520 Body Muon LR cooldown shape sweep** — alternative profiles over the load-bearing 30% cooldown window.

### ✅ thorfinn #520 — Body Muon LR cooldown shape sweep — CLOSED 07:55 UTC productive-NEGATIVE

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27261−3.27174|=0.00087): A linear=3.27261, B cosine=+0.00163 (marginal regression), C quadratic=+0.00864 (strong regression, fst=-1), D linear_floor=+0.01401 (strongest, fst=-1). Monotone with non-linear distortion of the final-window decay. **Mechanism**: body Muon needs (1) decay to ~zero at end, (2) linear shape (not steeper, not slower). NS-orthogonalized updates have rank-stable magnitudes — late-phase convergence requires actual zero LR to land. **Striking per-group cooldown contrast**: embed wins with linear_floor (#235), body LOSES strongest with linear_floor — different update statistics demand different profiles. Per-group cooldown-shape design axis substantially characterized (lm_head #547 in flight completes the matrix). **30th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: thorfinn assigned **#554 AdamW embed WD cooldown nudge** — adds small positive WD on embed during cooldown only (currently WD=0). Tests whether late-phase implicit regularization on sparse-row embed group helps; structurally distinct from edward #550 (Muon WD REDUCTION, body group, removes existing).

### ✅ thorfinn #590 — NS-cooldown START_FRAC sweep — CLOSED 23:50 UTC productive-NULL

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27089−3.27174|=0.00085): A=3.27089, B (0.50)=+0.00187 (regression), C (0.85)=+0.00132 (null), D (0.60)=−0.00041 (null sub-threshold). FRAC axis is **bilaterally concave at 0.70** with flat 0.60-0.70 shoulder. Mechanism reading: NS=16 only pays off in final ~25-30% of training; extending the window earlier (B) wastes compute on mid-phase steps that don't benefit from tighter orthogonalization, shortening (C) loses late-phase precision gain. The favorable A-drift (−0.00085) inflates D's apparent baseline improvement; within-pod Δ_vs_A=−0.00041 is far below the −0.002 candidate threshold. Closes off both "extended precision window" and "concentrated late NS=16 burst" follow-up directions. Full NS-cooldown sub-stack: magnitude=#176 (MERGED), shape=#285 (MERGED), coef=#290 (MERGED), timing=#590 (CLOSED). **41st productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: thorfinn assigned **#624 spectral norm penalty (WAVE3 IDEA 8)** — loss-side weight conditioning regularizer, structurally fresh axis no prior experiment has touched. After 41 productive-NULLs on optimizer-state and update-direction axes, pivot to loss-formulation axis.

### ✅ thorfinn #624 — Spectral norm penalty (loss-side weight conditioning) — CLOSED 06:10 UTC productive-NULL

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27261−3.27174|=0.00087): A=3.27261, B (λ=1e-5 all)=3.27216 (Δ=−0.00045, null), C (λ=5e-5 all)=3.27155 (Δ=−0.00106, null sub-threshold), D (λ=1e-5 attn_only)=3.27408 (Δ=+0.00147 marginal regression). **Monotone-favorable** in λ across all-scope arms (A→B→C: +0.0 / −0.00045 / −0.00106) but best magnitude is half the −0.002 candidate threshold; D regression on attn-only narrowest-scope informs mechanism. **Mechanism findings**: (a) spectral norm penalty is benign-mild on body Muon 2D matrices — never approaches catastrophic regression even at 5e-5 (5× the working range); (b) **body MLP matrices benefit more from spectral conditioning than attention matrices** (D attn-only regresses while B all-scope improves marginally), suggesting MLP layers were closer to singular-value concentration than attention; (c) the NS-conditions-update-direction-not-weight reading was directionally validated but quantitative impact too small to merge. Implementation hygiene clean (id()-intersection filter for spectral_params shadow set works, power-iteration v persistent across steps, ~3% overhead reproducible). **47th productive-null/negative this cycle.** "Loss-side weight regularization" axis (closest analog to WD but on σ_max² vs ‖W‖_F²) now characterized — penalizes only dominant singular values rather than all uniformly; the substantive distinction from WD shows up as direction-correct sub-threshold gain not a structural win. **Durable finding (cross-experiment reusable)**: id()-intersection filter pattern for restricting param-list operations to the body Muon 2D subset works cleanly when applied to penalty/regularization-style passes — a pattern future loss-side or post-NS modifications can reuse.
**Follow-up**: thorfinn assigned **per-block-type body Muon WD asymmetry** — structurally fresh per-block-type WD axis directly motivated by #550 (uniform body WD reduction toward 0, mean Δ=−0.00090 sub-threshold winner at n=3) and #579 askeladd in-flight (uniform-axis null but compound D attn-LR=0.80 + mlp-LR=1.20 = Δ=−0.00137 single-seed sub-threshold). Tests whether the marginal WD-reduction signal in #550 is concentrated in one block type (attn or mlp), and parallels #579's per-block-type LR axis. Per-block-type WD has never been tested separately from uniform body WD axis. Mechanism reading: with NS-orthogonalized updates having identical spectral magnitudes across blocks, per-block-type WD is the ONLY remaining structural lever to differentiate attn vs mlp regularization friction on body Muon.

### ✅ thorfinn #554 — AdamW embed WD cooldown nudge — CLOSED 15:35 UTC productive-NEGATIVE

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27277−3.27174|=0.00103): A=3.27277, B (0.001)=−0.00035 (null edge, fails baseline parity +0.00068), C (0.005)=+0.00657 (regression), D (0.010)=+0.01571 (regression, **FAILS 3.28 target**). Clean monotone regression — any embed WD during cooldown is harmful. Mechanism: with EMBED_COOLDOWN_SHAPE=linear_floor holding embed LR at 15% floor, embed updates are already small; adding WD uniformly shrinks rarely-updated rare-token rows whose representations depend on *accumulated information*. **Bilateral asymmetry on WD-cooldown axis** (paired with #550 winner candidate): embed group rejects added WD during cooldown (NEGATIVE), body Muon group may benefit from REDUCED WD during cooldown (#550 N=1 winner, paired-pod confirming). Both point to "do not constrain rare/sparse representations during cooldown precision window". **36th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: thorfinn assigned **NS-cooldown START_FRAC sweep** — fresh untested axis. NS_COOLDOWN_START_FRAC=0.7 was bundled at #176 merge, never independently swept on merged stack.

### ✅ askeladd #452 — Block output projection init scale — CLOSED 05:05 UTC productive-null

Paired-pod confirmation: Arm B (s=0.5) pod-0 candidate Δ=−0.00227 reversed → mean(Δ_pool)=+0.00068 across n=3 pods. 4th paired-pod false-positive caught this cycle (after #344, #351, #408 AGC). DeepNet/T-Fixup family init-scaling axis closed: NS-normalized Muon updates wash out init scaling within first ~100 steps as hypothesized — but no preserved benefit signal. **27th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: askeladd assigned **#543 per-block NS iter budget** — spatial allocation by aspect ratio (Bernstein-Newhouse). (#542 Lion-aux mis-assignment closed 05:12 UTC — Lion on aux groups already closed in #77, prior round.)

### 🔄 askeladd #579 — Body Muon LR asymmetry (attn vs mlp) [single-seed COMPLETE 21:36 UTC; SENT BACK 21:50 UTC for paired-pod confirmation of compound D]

**Branch:** `g1r4-askeladd/muon-attn-mlp-lr-asym`

**Single-seed 4-arm result** (drift gate A PASS, |3.27189−3.27174|=0.00015):
| Arm | attn | mlp | val/loss | Δ vs A | first_step |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| A | 1.00 | 1.00 | 3.27189 | — (drift +0.00015 PASS) | 3225 |
| B | 0.80 | 1.00 | 3.27272 | +0.00083 (null) | 3250 |
| C | 1.00 | 1.20 | 3.27269 | +0.00080 (null) | 3250 |
| D | **0.80** | **1.20** | **3.27052** | **−0.00137 (signal, sub-threshold)** | **3225** |

**Pre-staged pattern rule fires exactly**: singletons B/C both null, compound D direction-correct improvement. Sub-threshold of −0.002 mark at n=1. Drift gate clean (+0.00015) confirms implementation correct. **Mechanism**: attn matrices want conservative effective step (less jitter in routing) + mlp matrices want larger step; sub-threshold individually, compose when both applied — aspect-ratio shift between body-Muon matrix types.

**Paired-pod follow-up assigned 21:50 UTC**: 2-arm × 3-pod (A=(1.00, 1.00) ctrl + D=(0.80, 1.20) treatment, 6 runs total, ~6h × 3 parallel pods or ~10.8h sequential). Decision rule predeclared: Δ_mean ≤ −0.002 AND (3.28 − μ_D_mean)·√3 ≥ 0.004 AND μ_D_mean ≤ 3.27174 ⇒ MERGE; else close.

### ✅ askeladd #543 — Per-block NS iter budget — CLOSED 13:35 UTC productive-NULL

Single-seed 4-arm sweep (drift gate A PASS, |3.27243−3.27174|=0.00069): A uniform=3.27243, B aspect=+0.00077 (null), C manual_typeA=−0.00017 (null, best), D manual_typeB=+0.00056 (null). All 3 reallocation arms in productive-null band [−0.002, +0.0015]. NS=12 saturation **robust to spatial reallocation** — combined with #470 uniform escalation finding, NS-iter count is genuinely saturated at this budget. Architectural finding (student-documented): codebase uses split-qkv naming (`attn.q`/`attn.k`/`attn.v` all 768×768 square) — only 2-of-6 Muon blocks (`mlp.fc`, `mlp.proj`) have aspect > 1.0, limiting the spatial reallocation surface. **34th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: askeladd assigned **Body Muon LR asymmetry (attn vs mlp split)** — per-block-TYPE LR axis (vs #543 per-block iter), structurally distinct from #393 (AdamW per-group LR) and #409 (LLRD depth-LR).

### ✅ nezuko #454 — lm_head/scalar cooldown shape extension — CLOSED 18:05 UTC productive-null

Arms B/C/D (lm_head_floor, scalar_floor, both): best Δ=−0.00098 (arm B), half the −0.002 threshold. Arm D (stacked) regresses +0.00072 vs A, indicating cross-group interaction at end-of-cooldown. **linear_floor is embed-specific** (sparse-row coverage benefit), not aux-generic. Three prior paired-pod false-positives (#344, #351, #408 AGC) support conservative close. **20th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: nezuko assigned **#490 NAdam (Nesterov-AdamW) scope sweep** — first-moment reformulation, first Adam-family axis we haven't tested.

### ✅ nezuko #490 — NAdam (Nesterov-AdamW) scope sweep — CLOSED 02:15 UTC productive-null

Arms B (embed: Δ=−0.00059, mild +), C (lm_head: Δ=+0.00063, mild −), D (all_aux: Δ=+0.00275, regression). Best arm B well within null band (need ≤−0.002); D's compounded regression suggests scalar group is bad actor under NAdam (aggressive direction-change due to normalization layers). **26th productive-null/negative this cycle.** Closes the first-moment axis of the AdamW-internal three-axis ablation (magnitude #442 NEGATIVE, first-moment #490 null/regress, second-moment #474 NEGATIVE) — **AdamW-internal axis family substantially exhausted on merged stack**.
**Follow-up**: nezuko assigned **#530 Nesterov-Muon body scope sweep** — structurally parallel test on Muon body momentum (lookahead before NS).

### ✅ nezuko #530 — Nesterov-Muon body scope sweep — CLOSED 10:15 UTC productive-NULL

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27253−3.27174|=0.00079): A α=0.95=3.27253, B α=0.00 (bypass)=+0.00630 (regression), C α=0.50 (half-mix)=+0.04114 (severe, target NOT reached), D α=0.99 (over-Nesterov)=+0.00060 (null). **Structural finding**: the cliff is on the *low-α* side (NS-stability breakdown when current-grad weight >>0.05); the plateau is on the *high-α* side (Arm D within noise). α=μ=0.95 sits at boundary of safety — the mix is best understood as a tiny anti-staleness injection (~5% current-grad on top of 95% EMA), small enough to stay in NS's well-behaved spectral domain. Heavier current-grad injection pushes the NS input outside the Newton-Schulz polynomial's well-conditioned regime. **5th body-Muon mechanism axis closed** (joins #102 LR warmup, #356 μ schedule, #434 Lookahead-wrap, #483 WD warmup). Body Muon algorithmic axes on the merged stack are largely exhausted — future body-Muon ideas should target architectural changes (post-NS-side modifications, NS-iteration-count interactions). **32nd productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: nezuko assigned **#568 Per-group cooldown_frac decoupling** — fresh structural axis on per-group cooldown WINDOW LENGTH (vs per-group cooldown SHAPE which is largely characterized).

### ✅ nezuko #568 — Per-group cooldown_frac decoupling — CLOSED 18:40 UTC productive-NULL

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27134−3.27174|=0.00040): A=3.27134, B (embed=0.80)=−0.00014 (null), C (embed=0.60)=**+0.00242 (regression)**, D (body=0.80)=−0.00067 (null, best). No arm crosses −0.002 signal threshold. Best arm D passes single-seed stat-rule at n=1 ((3.28−3.27067)×√1=0.00933 ≥ 0.004) AND beats baseline (3.27067 ≤ 3.27174), BUT within-pod Δ=−0.00067 short of pre-staged paired-pod gate. Embed direction asymmetric-monotonic with floor at 0.70 (shortening hurts; lengthening gives only sub-threshold improvement). Body direction mildly positive sub-threshold (NS-orthogonalized landing benefits *mildly* from longer precision-window but not enough at ±0.10 perturbation). **SHAPE→FRAC analogy fails at this perturbation scale**: per-group cooldown SHAPE matters (real asymmetry) but per-group cooldown WINDOW LENGTH does NOT show same asymmetry within ±0.10 of 0.70. **39th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: nezuko assigned **#603 AdamW second-moment warmstart via ghost steps** — fresh untested mechanism addressing cold-start direction problem in `exp_avg_sq` that bias correction (magnitude rescaling) explicitly does not solve. Pre-training ghost-step loop accumulates m_t, v_t without weight updates; first ~100 training steps then operate on directionally-informed second-moment estimates instead of cold-start zero.

### ✅ nezuko #603 — AdamW ghost-step warmstart — CLOSED 00:10 UTC broken-chain + productive-NEGATIVE

Chain thrashed for ~5h with 6+ crashes across arms. Student identified key implementation limitation: `proj.weight=0` init at line 828 blocks gradient flow back through model during ghost steps (zero-inits all "proj" weights so `F.linear` backward `grad_input = grad_output @ proj.weight = 0`). Ghost steps thus only warm `lm_head` AdamW second-moment, NOT embed or scalar. The single completed arm (C ghost=25) reached **val=3.3018** — a +0.030 catastrophic regression vs baseline 3.27174, indicating ghost-step warmstart of lm_head's AdamW v_t is actively harmful. **43rd productive-NULL/NEGATIVE this cycle.** WAVE3 IDEA 7 (cold-start v_t direction) axis: closed. **Key durable finding (reusable across this programme): proj.weight=0 init blocks all upstream grad flow during pre-step probes — future optimizer-state-warming experiments must account for this.**
**Follow-up**: nezuko assigned **#628 trust-region adaptive Muon LR** — per-layer cos-EMA boost on rare-aligned layers. First experiment to AMPLIFY the rare-productive-direction signal rather than suppress conflict (vs #126 Contra-Soft attenuate, #163 DMR reset, #419 Cautious mask — all closed). Mechanistically distinct from all closed gradient-direction-aware mechanisms.

### 🔄 nezuko #628 — Trust-region adaptive Muon LR (per-layer cos-EMA boost) [assigned 00:15 UTC]

**Branch:** `g1r4-nezuko/trust-region-muon-lr`
**Hypothesis**: After 43 productive-NULLs, structurally distinct mechanism — boost Muon LR on layers where grad·momentum cosine EMA is positive (rare-productive layers per #154 90% conflict finding). Per-layer cos_ema tracks long-run direction agreement; trust_scale = 1 + boost × max(cos_ema, 0). Leaves common-conflict case at LR=1.0 (no harm), amplifies rare-aligned layers (productive signal). Distinct from #163 DMR (resets buffer), #126 Contra-Soft (attenuates gradient), #419 Cautious (masks elements), #120/#434 Lookahead (blends weights).

### ✅ frieren #470 — NS iterations NORMAL phase sweep — CLOSED 20:55 UTC productive-null

Arms B=8 (+0.00235 regression), C=10 (−0.00168 null), D=14 (−0.00145 null). Wide saturation plateau NS ∈ [10, 14]; NS=8 below floor. **Critical compute finding: NS step-time is flat (±1%) across all NS values — orthogonalization is not the per-step bottleneck.** 21st productive-null/negative.
**Follow-up**: frieren assigned **#506 NS-iter warmup schedule** — ramp NS from {8,10} → 12 over first 5-10%.

### ✅ frieren #593 — Per-group AdamW WD sweep — CLOSED 00:05 UTC productive-NULL

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS exceptional parity |3.27167−3.27174|=0.00007): A=3.27167, B (lm_head WD=0.01)=+0.00192 (regression marginal), C (scalar WD=0.01)=−0.00017 (productive-null sub-noise-floor), D (joint)=−0.00022 (productive-null sub-noise-floor). No arm clears −0.002 signal threshold. **42nd productive-NULL/NEGATIVE this cycle.** **Cross-axis WD-ADDITION pattern now fully fenced**: AdamW lm_head WD ADD (B regress), AdamW scalar WD ADD (null), AdamW embed WD ADD (#554 NEG), Muon body WD warmup ADD (#483 NEG). Only WD direction with extractable gain on merged stack is REDUCTION (#550 Muon body WD cooldown reduce, paired-pod in-flight). Strengthens "baseline is locally optimal across WD axis; cooldown handles regularization adequately".
**Follow-up**: frieren assigned **#629 Layer-aggregate Contra-Soft Muon** — fills explicit untested gap diagnosed in #126 closure (element-wise Contra-Soft attenuated ~13-50% of gradient mass uniformly across granularities; layer-aggregate operates only on whole-matrix cosine, preserving productive-direction layers entirely). Distinct from #628 (boosts via LR scaling); this attenuates via gradient scaling on conflict-layers only.

### 🔄 frieren #629 — Layer-aggregate Contra-Soft Muon (per-layer scalar cosine attenuation) [assigned 00:15 UTC]

**Branch:** `g1r4-frieren/layer-contra-soft-muon`
**Hypothesis**: #126 element-wise Contra-Soft closed clean negative; closing diagnosis suggested layer-aggregate aggregation is untested and likely the variant that succeeds. This PR fills that gap. Per-layer scalar cosine `cos(grad, momentum)` ∈ [-1, +1]; scale = 1 + α·min(cos, 0) attenuates ONLY layers with overall conflicting direction (cos<0), leaves productive-direction layers unchanged. Compared to #126: same α values (0.25, 0.50, 1.00) at different aggregation level — direct A/B against closed variant.

Paired-pod n=3 confirmation: all 3 pods regress (mean Δ=+0.00087, wrong sign). Gates 1+2 fail (mean Δ above 0, mean val_B 3.27329 > baseline 3.27174). The N=1 Δ_C=−0.00119 was an Arm-A drift artifact (original Arm A drifted +0.00108 above baseline; paired-pod Arm-A controls anchor at +0.00068). **5th cycle precedent for single-seed → paired-pod collapse** (joins #344, #351, #408, #487). **NS-axis program now fully fenced**: 3/3 NS-iter schedule axes closed by frieren (warmup #506, normal-phase #470, cooldown saturation #388) + 3 cooldown-machinery components MERGED (#176, #285, #290) + sub-stack pruning #487 null + spatial #543 null. **37th productive-null/negative this cycle.**
**Follow-up**: frieren assigned **per-group AdamW WD sweep** — currently WD=0 uniformly across embed/lm_head/scalar; whether dense lm_head or small-param scalar groups benefit from WD>0 has never been tested. Structurally distinct from #554 (embed WD ADD cooldown, NEGATIVE — sparse-row mechanism), #550 (Muon body WD), #483 (Muon WD warmup, NEGATIVE).

Arms B (embed: +0.04081), C (lm_head: +0.00188), D (all-aux: +0.03479). D ≈ B trajectory confirms embed group dominates catastrophic regression. Root cause: AdaBelief's `(g−m)²` fails on sparse-row embed (absent rows have g=0 but m≠0 → `(g−m)²=m²`, inflating denominator globally). lm_head: stable mild regression. **23rd productive-null/negative this cycle.** Second-moment-formulation axis fully closed.
**Follow-up**: edward assigned **#516 Yogi optimizer on aux groups** — sign-based additive second-moment update (avoids embed sparsity pathology, structurally distinct).

### ✅ edward #516 — Yogi optimizer on aux groups — CLOSED 07:00 UTC productive-NEGATIVE (embed/all-aux) + productive-NULL (lm_head)

Single-seed 4-arm (drift gate A PASS, |3.27419−3.27174|=0.00245 ≤ 0.003): A=3.27419, B embed=+0.00386 (regression), C lm_head=+0.00038 (null), D all-aux=+0.00447 (regression). D ≈ B + 0.00061 — embed regression dominates; lm_head and scalars contribute marginally. Mechanism reading: Yogi's faster-additive v_t reaction destabilizes sparse-row embed at β₂=0.99 (regression grows monotonically through cooldown); dense lm_head indistinguishable from AdamW. Independent of AdaBelief mechanism (#474): Yogi accumulates g² same as AdamW. **Closes second-moment-update-rule axis** — joined with #474 AdaBelief, #442 Adam-atan2, #490 NAdam-aux. **29th productive-null/negative this cycle.**

**Branch:** `g1r4-edward/embed-stack-redundancy`
**Hypothesis**: After 45 productive-NULL/NEGATIVE closures (per-group AdamW family fully exhausted; β₁/β₂/WD all closed-NEG), pivots from within-axis perturbation to **stack-component redundancy ablation**. Tests whether the two embed-side merged components — EMBED_COOLDOWN_SHAPE=linear_floor (#235; holds embed LR at 15% floor through cooldown) and ADAMW_EMBED_LR_MULT=1.5 (#393; raises embed base LR 50%) — are jointly load-bearing or one subsumes the other. Both raise late-phase embed effective LR via mechanistically distinct routes (geometric shape vs multiplicative scale); their interaction has never been tested (#235 landed pre-LR_MULT; #393 landed pre-LR_MULT-as-merged). Structurally parallels #487/#577 (NS-cooldown sub-stack joint pruning, tanjiro) on embed-side LR pressure sub-stack.

| Arm | EMBED_COOLDOWN_SHAPE | ADAMW_EMBED_LR_MULT | Mechanism tested |
|---|---|---:|---|

## Research theme — current cycle

**47 productive-null/negative results** on optimizer-internal / parameter-temporal / loss-side / WD / cooldown-schedule / per-group / optimizer-family / loss-side-weight-regularization axes. The strongest confirmed findings:
1. **The cooldown phase is load-bearing signal, not noise.** Any mechanism that blends, averages, or smooths parameters/gradients during the cooldown window hurts:
   - #436 weight-EMA → productive-NEGATIVE
   - #434 Lookahead → productive-NEGATIVE (Muon wrapping 4.5× worse)
   - #399 AdEMAMix → productive-null
   - #419 Cautious AdamW → productive-null
2. **Loss-side auxiliary regularization is exhausted.** Softcap c=15 is optimal (#354) and already bounds the logit-distribution axes that z-loss (#441) and label smoothing (#446) target. Both regress monotonically.
3. **Additive regularization always fails on this stack.** AGC, GC, gradient noise, label smoothing, z-loss — all hurt.

**Current open questions** (in-flight):
1. ~~Does NS-iter warmup (low → 12 over first N%) extract benefit from early gradient noise?~~ **#506 CLOSED productive-NEGATIVE** — all 3 pods regress, 5th single-seed→paired-pod collapse precedent; NS-axis program fully fenced.
2. ~~Does per-block NS iter allocation (by aspect ratio) help over uniform NS=12?~~ **#543 CLOSED productive-NULL** — NS=12 saturation robust to spatial reallocation; codebase has limited surface (only 2-of-6 Muon blocks non-square).
3. ~~Does lm_head cooldown SHAPE (cosine / late_peak / linear_floor) matter vs default linear?~~ **#547 CLOSED productive-NULL** — lm_head wants monotonic linear; late_peak doesn't cross-axis transfer from NS.
4. Does Muon WD reduction during cooldown extract precision-window gain? (**#550, edward — N=1 Arm D WD=0 Δ=−0.00337 strong winner candidate; sent back for paired-pod n=3 confirmation, identical protocol to #487; non-linear axis response (only WD=0 extracts gain) is structurally novel; either fresh merge candidate or 5th single-seed→paired-pod collapse**)
5. ~~Does adding small WD on AdamW embed during cooldown help?~~ **#554 CLOSED productive-NEGATIVE** — clean monotone regression; embed group rejects added WD during cooldown; bilateral asymmetry with #550 (body benefits from REDUCED WD, embed rejects ADDED WD).
6. ~~Does per-group AdamW β₂ asymmetry extract per-group second-moment time-constant gains?~~ **#560 CLOSED productive-NULL/NEGATIVE** — embed β₂=0.999 regression (+0.00359), β₂=0.95 null (+0.00089), D inert; AdamW-internal axis family substantially exhausted.
7. Does per-group cooldown WINDOW LENGTH asymmetry around 0.70 baseline extract gains? (#568, nezuko — fresh structural axis paralleling SHAPE work)
8. Is the *entire* NS-cooldown sub-stack jointly load-bearing even though each component is individually redundant? (#487 follow-up, tanjiro — joint-pruning ablation, structurally novel compound subtraction)

**Stack convergence signal**: 28 productive-null/negative results. The baseline at 3.27174 is well-tuned. New wins will likely come from:
1. **"Less constraint early" schedule cluster** (in flight): NS-iter warmup (#506), β₁ warmup (#514) — early-phase schedule axes. WD warmup (#483) and embed-LR warmup (#489) both closed productive-NEGATIVE — bilateral structural finding.
2. **Late-phase cooldown shape**: body Muon LR cooldown shape (#520 thorfinn) — targeting the load-bearing 30% cooldown window.
3. **Stack simplification** — #487 paired-pod n=3 CLOSED productive-NULL (Arm B drop NS_ITERS_COOLDOWN: mean Δ=+0.00003, classified redundant but not improved). All three sub-stack components (NS_ITERS_COOLDOWN, NS_COOLDOWN_SHAPE=late_peak, NS_COEF_SCHEDULE=linear_ramp_down) are individually classified as redundant under their respective single-drop tests; **joint-drop interaction is untested** — that's the natural next step (follow-up assigned to tanjiro). If joint-drop ≈ baseline, the entire NS-cooldown machinery can be retired.
4. **Non-AdamW body-Muon mechanism axis** — Nesterov-Muon (#530, nezuko new) targets lookahead-before-NS, complementing pre-stage NS scheduling (#506) and shape (#520). The AdamW-internal three-axis ablation is closing (#442 NEGATIVE + #474 NEGATIVE + #490 null = body-side is the natural pivot).
5. **Bilateral regularization closure (from #483 + #489)**: both ADD (17 axes) and REDUCE-by-warmup (Muon-WD, embed-LR) regularization fail → early-training window is bilaterally well-tuned.
6. **Aux-group coupled system insight (from #477)**: future aux-group mechanism experiments should default to "all aux" scope; single-group regresses.
7. **Embed sparsity structural insight (from #474)**: `(g − m)²`-based second moments fail on embed group; `g²`-only formulations (AdamW, Yogi) are safe.

**Optimizer-internal / Adam-family**:
- **β₁ per-group: CLOSED productive-NEGATIVE** (#599; B=+0.00399/C=+0.00513/D=+0.00177; both directions; **per-group AdamW family fully exhausted** — β₁ + β₂ + WD all closed-NEGATIVE; only embed-LR-mult #393 extracted gain)

- ε per-group: all swept, β₂=0.99/ε=1e-10 confirmed
- WD per-group: **bilaterally fenced — ADDITION (#554/#593/#483) all NEG; REDUCTION (#550, n=3 paired) sub-threshold NULL at mean Δ=−0.00090; cooldown-window precision is structural, not WD-friction-bound**
- Gradient noise injection, GC, Cautious, AdEMAMix, Lookahead, Weight-EMA, AGC, OrthoGrad: all closed
- AdaBelief variance-of-prediction-error second moment: CLOSED productive-NEGATIVE (#474; embed sparsity pathology; `(g−m)²` fails on absent-row sparse groups)
- Muon-WD warmup (all fracs 5-20%): CLOSED productive-NEGATIVE (#483; monotone worsening; body WD=0.025 is bilaterally optimal)
- Lion, Adafactor on aux: closed (prior rounds)
- LLRD Muon: closed (NS normalizes depth scaling)
- AdamW LR per-group (embed=1.5× MERGED #393): embed_mult swept, scalar/lm_head confirmed optimal at 1.0×
- Adam-atan2 magnitude-transform (b∈{0.3,1.0,3.0}): CLOSED productive-NEGATIVE (#442; ε=1e-8 already optimal)
- NAdam (Nesterov-AdamW) aux scope sweep: CLOSED productive-null (#490; best arm B Δ=−0.00059 within null, joint D Δ=+0.00275 regression — scalars likely bad actor)
- Nesterov-Muon body weight sweep α∈{0.0, 0.50, 0.99}: CLOSED productive-NULL (#530; cliff on low-α side: α=0.50 catastrophic +0.04114 fst=-1, α=0.99 plateau null +0.00060; existing α=μ=0.95 is load-bearing AND optimally weighted; mechanism: tiny anti-staleness injection on top of NS-stable EMA; 5th body-Muon mechanism closure; 32nd null this cycle)

**NS precision family**:
- NS_ITERS_COOLDOWN: saturated (#388); **#487 Arm B (drop) at paired-pod n=3: mean(Δ)=+0.00003 — CLASSIFIED REDUNDANT** (not load-bearing, not improved); 4th cycle precedent for N=1 → paired-pod collapse
- NS cooldown SHAPE=late_peak: MERGED #285; #487 Arm C drop = +0.00080 null at N=1
- NS coef schedule=linear_ramp_down: MERGED #290; #487 Arm D drop = +0.00066 null at N=1

- Embed linear_floor: MERGED #235
- lm_head steeper-decay: harmful (#315)
- lm_head + scalar floor: CLOSED productive-null (#454; embed-specific mechanism, not aux-generic)
- **lm_head cooldown SHAPE (cosine/late_peak/linear_floor)**: CLOSED productive-NULL (#547; cross-axis NS late_peak transfer falsified, +0.00179 biggest regression; lm_head wants monotonic linear; reproduces #454 linear_floor null; per-group SHAPE design space now substantially characterized — only scalar untested)
- Muon μ schedule: catastrophic; constant μ=0.95 confirmed (#356)
- Muon LR floor: monotone worse (#335)
- Embed-only LR warmup (frac∈{0.02, 0.05, 0.10}): CLOSED productive-NEGATIVE (#489; monotone catastrophic worsening; full embed LR from step 0 is load-bearing; 25th null this cycle)
- Embed LR step-0 boost (decay to 1.5×): CLOSED productive-NULL (#526; B/C plateau at Δ≈−0.0008 within noise floor; D longer window mildly worse; bilateral closure with #489; 31st null this cycle — embed step-0 LR=1.5× is bilaterally optimal)
- **Embed AdamW WD cooldown nudge (additive)**: CLOSED productive-NEGATIVE (#554; monotone regression A→D, B=+0.00068 null-edge fails baseline parity, C=+0.00657 regression, D=+0.01571 fails 3.28 target; mechanism: embed sparse-row representations depend on accumulated info not noise; WD overrides accumulation; bilateral asymmetry with #550 candidate)

**Init**:
- Embed init scale: null (#374)
- lm_head init std: monotone worse (#380)
- Block output projection init scale: in-flight (#452)

**Loss-side**:
- Logit softcap=15: confirmed optimal (#354)

**Clipping**:
- clip=5 → clip=10: MERGED #165
